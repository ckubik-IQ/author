The capabilities of Government Intelligence in reference with watching people within their homes.


Ever wonder if someone is watching you sleep? What if I told you, not only do they have the ability to see through walls, but they can see your eye movements behind your eyelids. What if I told you they had the capability to propagate sound into a room they are not in… Of course that’s dependent on distance, if they are close, this capability is not quite as refined, they lack the ability to have the same capability at 5m vs 50m.

Indicators your device has been compromised
-	Keep an eye on when specific icons show up on the top status bar of your device, does it seem like the timing and sequence is because someone is specifically looking for it? i.e If youre simply scrolling news articles, maybe it goes on and off occasionally, but then you cover the camera, and all of a sudden the location indicator stays in place. This is contradictory to how the behavior was previously, this is an indicator. 
-	The intelligence services will route traffic through a cloudflare server so that they have anonymity and plausible deniability, but CF would never disclose they are in contract with the USG. 
The Only Solution
-	After collecting logs, data, screenshots, and other artifacts, open source it. Let the community dig in and see what they can find. I am not expert enough to determine how everything works, but the open source community does. After 6 months of collecting data, lets see what the world can come up with.

Fatally consequential probelem:
I am a 23 year old woman. When I get excited about a boy I am interested in, I get my underwear a little moist. 
With the USG Intelligence services watching me, they can tell when I get my panties wet, indicating I am interest in a boy. 
I think this is a big violation of privacy, its almost the same as
What if I was a boy, and I got a hard on for specific events in my life. 
This is essentially the same as a girl getting wet panties. 
Now, the United States Government is watching a 23 year old girl, in her home, texting a boy, getting wet in her panties, and the United States Government is commenting on "oh she is getting wet because of this". 
Is that a violation of privacy?

Lets see what the public thinks
