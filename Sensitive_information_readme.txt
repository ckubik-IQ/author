The capabilities of Government Intelligence in reference with watching people within their homes.


Ever wonder if someone is watching you sleep? What if I told you, not only do they have the ability to see through walls, but they can see your eye movements behind your eyelids. What if I told you they had the capability to propagate sound into a room they are not in… Of course that’s dependent on distance, if they are close, this capability is not quite as refined, they lack the ability to have the same capability at 5m vs 50m.

Indicators your device has been compromised
-	Keep an eye on when specific icons show up on the top status bar of your device, does it seem like the timing and sequence is because someone is specifically looking for it? i.e If youre simply scrolling news articles, maybe it goes on and off occasionally, but then you cover the camera, and all of a sudden the location indicator stays in place. This is contradictory to how the behavior was previously, this is an indicator. 
-	The intelligence services will route traffic through a cloudflare server so that they have anonymity and plausible deniability, but CF would never disclose they are in contract with the USG. 
The Only Solution
-	After collecting logs, data, screenshots, and other artifacts, open source it. Let the community dig in and see what they can find. I am not expert enough to determine how everything works, but the open source community does. After 6 months of collecting data, lets see what the world can come up with.

Fatally consequential probelem:
I am a 23 year old woman. When I get excited about a boy I am interested in, I get my underwear a little moist. 
With the USG Intelligence services watching me, they can tell when I get my panties wet, indicating I am interest in a boy. 
I think this is a big violation of privacy, its almost the same as
What if I was a boy, and I got a hard on for specific events in my life. 
This is essentially the same as a girl getting wet panties. 
Now, the United States Government is watching a 23 year old girl, in her home, texting a boy, getting wet in her panties, and the United States Government is commenting on "oh she is getting wet because of this". 
Is that a violation of privacy?
Okay, now lets say, as this 23 yo girl is getting wet in her own home, the USG intelligence services is sharing this information with some random dude who knows someone in the intel services.
So the intel services are sharing information with this guy, say 25 yo, and he is getting up to the minute information on what the 23yo girl is doing, how she is actiing, if she is wet and or excited. 
Now, this guy shares this information with 30 of his fraternity brothers. And his girlfriend shows her 30 sorority sisters the intel. But All of it came from the tech and budget of the  UDG intel. 
And now, the 60 of these people are so interested in this hot girl who is getting her panties wet in front of about 20 of these people who are stationed in the 2 apartments tangential to her apartment.
Now these 20 people communicate with their friends stationed outside the apartment. They tell each other when the hot girl is taking her dog out. So every time the girl takes her dog out,
they are right outside to stalk and follow her. Now, how would dads feel about this? What if the situation were flipped, how would moms feel about this? 

Do you think discrict/circuit/ and federal judges would designate the situation different for  boys than for girls. I DIDNT FUCKING THINK SO 

Lets see what the public thinks
